# Augmented Reality for Geospatial Applications

A building ground to assess the potential of AR in representing complex geographical data in an intuitive and interactive manner.

Currently, this is a simple Vue demonstrator application which uses AR.js to instantiate a camera view, register a simple company tag (the one at the top of this document) and then render a cube. Please note that this project is still a work-in-progress, so the cube might not render fully or at all.
